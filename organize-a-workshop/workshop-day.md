## :star2: Workshop Day

### :snowman: Organizer and Mentors:
As an organizer, you are expected to arrive about 1 hour before the registration time to setup for the event.

Please also remember to remind your mentors to arrive at least half an hour before registration, so you can discuss logistics with them (such as installing software).

#### :art: What you need to do before the event starts?
1. Make sure you order food in place.
2. Make sure you have enough tables and chairs for student groups.
3. Make sure your presentation is ready.

### :pushpin: Registration
Depends on what day or the week is your workshop (usually on the weekends). The recommended start time is **10am**. A too-early time might discourage people from attending.


:name_badge: Remember to have name tags for attendees and mentors. It is a good way for them to get to know each other.


### :microphone: Opening Remarks

- Workshop Goal
- Sponsor (give sponsor a few minutes to introduce themselves)
- Schedule
- Mentors Intro
- Materials (wifi, tutorials, installation, etc.)
- Separate into groups
- Ice breaker
- Start coding


To see an example presentation on opening remarks, please go [here](../workshop-resources/ScalaBridge%20-%20NYC%202018.pdf).


### :couple: :two_women_holding_hands: :two_men_holding_hands: Grouping Students
There are two recommended ways to separate students into groups.
1. Based on student's technical background/ level
2. Based on student's goal and learning style (self-learning vs. pair-programming).


### :hammer: Installation
There are several choices for installation. To read more about the choices, plese visit [here](../workshop-resources/installation.md).


### :bookmark_tabs: Workshop Materials
ScalaBridge Workshop uses [Creative Scala Tutorial](http://creativescala.org/creative-scala.html).

The Creative Scala template used in this tutorial is [here](https://github.com/underscoreio/creative-scala-template).

**Visit [here](../workshop-resources/tutorial.md) to read more about tutorials.**


### :school: What should mentors do?
Rather than lecture-based, this is a hands-on workshop designed for self-paced learning. Mentors will be floating around, engaging and facilitating students in their learning. It is helpful if mentors could proactively engage with students, rather than always waiting for students to ask questions.

### :school_satchel: What should students do?
Students will work individually or in groups, depending on personal preferences, using the Creative Scala tutorial. They will ask questions and get help from the mentors.


### :two_hearts: At the end of the workshop:
Give a short closing presentation:
- Thank all the mentors and the sponsor
- Thank everyone who came
- Provide students [resources](https://scalabridge.gitbooks.io/curriculum/content/resources.html) to further learn Scala
- Provide info about Scala meetups and encourage students to join the community


### :sparkles: What else?

:ghost: **Be Creative!**

- :circus_tent: Talks
   
   Depending on how your workshop is organized, and how many people registered, you can try adding one or two interesting talks after lunch, since usually people are tired after lunch. A talk might be a good break.

- :cyclone: Chat Platform

   One of the goals of ScalaBridge is to bring diversity into the Scala community. It is a good idea to create a platform that allows people to ask questions and to keep in touch. Gitter is one of the good options. Please visit [Gitter ScalaBridgeLobby](https://gitter.im/scalabridgeboston/Lobby) for an example.


- :beers: Drinks

   Some workshops provide drinks for students after lunch.
   
- :tada: After Party

   This can be a good chance for people to network.
   
- :beer: Grab beer

   Sometimes mentors grab beers together after the workshop.
