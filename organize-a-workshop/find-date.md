# :calendar: Find An Event Date for the Workshop

**Optimal start time of this step: 3 months before the workshop**


The first step of organizing a ScalaBridge workshop is to find an optimal date for the workshop. If you are at this stage, then you're at the beginning of planning a workshop. It is recommended to find a date that is at least 3 months away, so you have enough time to [find sponsorship](./sponsorship.md), [find mentors](./invite-mentors.md), and [promote the event](./promote-workshop.md).

**Recommendations from experienced event/conference organizers are welcome!**


## :bookmark_tabs: How to find a date?

#### :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Standalone Workshop
If you're organizing a **standalone** ScalaBridge workshop (not with a conference), it is better to propose a few dates on the weekends so that most people are available to attend.

From my past experience of organizing ScalaBridge workshops, I usually personally reach out to a few interested mentors first to find out their availability. I've used [Doodle](https://doodle.com/) for collecting this information. The date for which the most mentors are available can be selected as the workshop date.

For example, if I am currently organizing a workshop in May, I will propose a few dates on the weekends in August or September for the mentors to choose.


#### :books: Conference Workshop
If you're organizing a workshop with a **conference**, usually the workshop is held the day before the conference.
